    <h1>Homework 3 Image 3</h1>
    <p>A cute little envelope that was sitting on some lockers in the 5th floor. The image is underexposed but I found the envelopes to be pretty cute.<p>

    <p>For this one I didn't know what more to do than simply expose it a bit more. However when I looked at the girls face on the envelope it kind of looked like she was crying (or it is like blush but let me be dramatic) almost as if maybe a person she loves hurt her. The lock also felt like it should be included to maybe enforce where the image is in real space (a locker), or to simply make the girl feel like she is trapped there :(. I also played with effects a little bit here adding grain to try to create a nostalgic feeling, don't know if it comes through though.<p>

    <h1>Homework 3 Image 5</h1>
    <p>A window near the classroom for our lab. Just wanted to take a picture as the sign is almost begging you with all the pleases. Thought it was pretty interesting.<p>

    <p>Cropped and tried to center the image to focus on the sign and have the bottom of the picture frame be the window frame, almost as a sort of horizon. I contemplated screwing with the image a bit more and making it far more exposed and almost heavenly looking, but decided to just keep it tame this week.<p>
