<p>My work is intended to try to convey the struggle of finding the self and how the internet has affected that. I wish to try to be able to put my thoughts out in a physical form where I can see and reflect on how I feel. I wish to show my interests and how they shape the person I am and what kind of person I am apart from these things. I want the media to have a homemade feel. I want the media to reflect how I've spent a lot of my life on the internet and it had a big impact on my life. I want to make video and photography to convey the self and have me be a part of my work. </p>
