    <h1>Homework 7:Illustrated Environment</h1>
    <p>I chose this environment because it looked fairly easy to reconstruct. It is simply a road with some buildings and garages or warehouses or something like that. But there was a very clear foreground and background and so I chose it. Although I struggled to start as I forgot how to use illustrator Alan helped me along and got me a nice set of colors which matched the vibe of the image. I mainly focused on getting the general idea that this is an urban environment across and did not try to play around too much with textures or anything like that, just wanted it to be clear colors. So my interpretation of the image is less detailed but gets the main point of the environment across. </p>
