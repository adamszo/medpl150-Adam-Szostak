    <p>Reflection on Motherhood in Crisis specifically about Memunatu's Chapter</p>
    <p>I read Memunatu’s chapter “Birth in my Village”. There was mainly illustration used in this story. They felt like a part of a comic strip or something you would see on webtoon but with a real person’s story. Having a combination of both text and images allows for the story to be more accessible and it’s easily readable. For example if we did not know of Memunatu’s story while she was having that first baby and there was no way to capture her pain in a picture it can just as easily be done with an illustration. Illustrations vary from photographs as they are less realistic. Seeing an illustration of someone going through a lot of pain still shows the viewer/reader the pain a person is going through but it doesn’t intrude on the person’s pain in the moment as if somebody just stuck a camera in your face at a sensitive point in your life. The illustrations in Memunatu’s chapter specifically show places like where she lived and showed her mental state at the time, the pictures towards the end showed Memunatu in a better place in the Aberdeen Women’s Centre where she is seen smiling and healthier. With some of the dialogue appearing after the initial page flip it also feels more engaging as you have time to read the description of a person or whatever the words convey see the illustration then go back and read the dialogue. The illustrations allow us to see the passing of time well as we can see when Memunatu starts going into labor it starts with the sun out, but after a couple pages you can see the caregiver getting out of the house and it is night time which showed that Memunatu struggled for a long time, this went along with the words as the words also reveal that she was in labor for two days. We are also exposed to Memunatu’s perspective really well as when she gave birth and the baby was dead, she said she did not want to see the baby and in the following panels we too do not see the baby and are just left to experience the loss of a child with Memunatu. We also see how in the hospital there are so many women who have experienced the same fate and were victims of these lie-lie nurses. There is also a picture of the plug that Memunatu has to use for the rest of her life, and how it is size 3. I think it is important to see this actual plug to experience the reality that Memunatu now has to experience. It also helps bring awareness to how something like this would look. And in one of the final panels we get to see Memunatu with a newborn baby, so we can see she got the child she wanted. The video at the end also gives more explanation and shows how the centre helped her and women like her, but scarily the centre had to close after that due to COVID-19.</p>
