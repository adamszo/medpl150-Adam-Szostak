    <h1>Homework 3: Shallow Depth of Field</h1>
    <p>Here I got the beautiful subject of a marker! Got a bit too anxious trying to ask a random person to be a subject but I don't think the assignment specified needing a human subject, at least I hope so ;-;. First time I borrowed the camera I kinda just sat in the media room after I tried asking once but everyone said no, just unlucky i suppose, but weird request to just ask random people for a picture especially when you are fiddling around lost with settings.</p>

    <h1>Homework 3: Deep Depth of Field</h1>
    <p> Although I think I used the same settings as the first one I feel like the colors and exposure look very different. Maybe I just messed up some settings on the camera, oopsieeee.<p>
