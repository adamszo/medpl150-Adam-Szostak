<p>My work is intended to try to convey the struggle of finding the self. I wish to try to be able to put my thoughts out in a physical form where I can see and reflect on how I feel easier. I wish to show my interests and how they shape the person I am and what kind of person I am apart from these things. I want the media to have a homemade feel.</p>
