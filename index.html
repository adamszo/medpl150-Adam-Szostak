<p>My work is intended to try to convey the struggle of finding the self and how the internet has affected my life. Finding the self is really important to me because I feel like I’ve been so lost in the distractions of the world that it's hard to understand myself. I wish to try to be able to put my thoughts out in a digital form where I can see and reflect on how I feel. I wish to show my interests and how they shape the person I am and what kind of person I am apart from these things. I want the media to have a homemade feel. I want this because I am imperfect and I am quite bad at art and the creative process so when I make art it will be imperfect and probably bad but I want it to feel like it has someone's feelings and life behind it. I want the media to reflect how I've spent a lot of my life on the internet and it had a big impact on my life. I want to make video and photography to convey the self and have me be a part of my work. My offline life also will influence my work as nature is very beautiful and feels so opposite to this technological world that I want some nature to be used as well. I want to use video and photography since those are forms of media that I feel like translate emotion very easily and emotion is a very big part of life. </p>
