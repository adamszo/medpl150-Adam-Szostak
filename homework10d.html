    <p>You pick yourself up and push towards the mound now moving. You try to position yourself above it to see whats in this mound. As you float up you feel as though you are being watched, somehow. You look down to see this mound, opening and closing. The inside looking like gel and this dark orb inside of it. Questions flood your thoughts.Have you opened an eye? And if so what eye is this? Why is it in the middle of this endless void? How do you approach this eye?</p>
