    <p>Reflection on “In Plato’s Cave” chapter 1 from On Photography by Susan Sontag</p>
    <p>
      To me, capturing an image is a way to observe and appreciate the world around you, in a tourist sort of way, but if you take that and apply it to your everyday life there can be beauty all around you. It can also be a way to document things that are happening around you whether that be how people take pictures of slides in class or just taking pictures of themselves and seeing how they change as they grow. Being behind a camera also feels very private and intimate. It feels like you are capturing something beautiful and it could just be for you to appreciate. Or you can share that with other people and give people a taste of how you see the world. An idea that Susan Sontag brings us that I think puts it excellently is “...the photographer stays behind his or her camera, creating a tiny element of another world…” (Page 11). This made me feel very understood by Sontag as it does feel like you are separating yourself from this modern world and creating a sort of pocket dimension that you have some control over. I think I am drawn to capturing people as this feels like getting to know someone in a small way. Also mood can affect what an image means to me as when I am feeling quite down I may want to focus on very different things to what I would focus on when I am feeling happy. Creating a graphic can help you convey yourself more creatively as you are creating something that can be entirely new. Creating something can be fulfilling as it gives me a joy that I can do something even if it isn’t particularly impressive. The digital age has also changed images and graphics greatly as it’s even easier than when Sontag was talking about how easy it was to take a photo. Now people make art all the time and document themselves living everyday and everybody can see that. A big part of the current world is on the internet as trends, communities, and livelihoods stem from there. For our current world there would be a lot of images of the harm that is being done. With many families being forced to be deported and separated there is a lot of pain that is coming from that. As well as the earth slowly being destroyed by us, like the great barrier reef slowly dying, or the Amazon rainforest, or any number of things that we do on a daily basis that harm the earth. I would describe the world right now as one full of pain and there is plenty of pain that can be shown in a photograph. Images like this are very powerful but I feel like they aren’t being valued enough. But the current world isn’t just pain there can also be beauty. Something like a very beautiful building or even seeing a friend group that seems to be having fun, these things can be captured to show that there are still good things in the world even if there is a lot of pain.
