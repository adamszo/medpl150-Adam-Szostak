    <h1>Homework 9</h1>
    <p>Reflection on The Brink</p>
    <p>Nuclear bombs have not been used in war since 1945. In the 80 years since there have been close calls with countries using nuclear threats. The fact that there are still nuclear warheads baffles me. I don’t understand why countries want to have this big of a threat just available at all times. It just doesn’t really benefit anybody. And although the amount of nuclear warheads has been reduced to 12,000 from 70,000 since cold war times it's amazing there is any left. Why do world leaders just play around with these threats? Maybe I just don’t understand something or else why would 9 countries just want to have this type of deadly bomb in their borders. I don’t see an argument for having a nuclear warhead ensures a type of safety from other nuclear warheads, because if that’s the case then one wrong move and everyone is going to die to these nukes. It just seems like everyone wants mutually assured destruction. It just amazes me that after 80 years that's all we have come to. It just feels like nobody in power cares enough to try to get rid of the possibility of nukes in this world. Or perhaps they have tried and other countries did not want to get rid of the power those nukes give them. Ultimately I’m not sure. This article's visuals were awesome and I loved how as you scrolled you would go through the illustrations and just see the effects that a nuclear bomb would have on an area. It just further cements the ridiculousness of nuclear bombs existing in my mind. Like how would someone look at this or real world examples from Hiroshima and Nagasaki and still feel a need to have something like this. Also the United States is planning to make another nuclear warhead program which will cost an estimated two trillion dollars. Like I genuinely don’t see a single reason to have more of them. If the United States already has around 4,000 which is probably more than enough to destroy the world, why are we burning more money on something as pointless as having more nukes? Just to have a slightly larger number than Russia, like then what? The United States people could use that two trillion dollars that would probably save so many people. But instead so many countries are all just spending infinite money on militaries. Like what's the point? Thinking about things like this really just makes me feel so useless. Maybe I’m just missing something I truly don’t know. But it's important that we keep talking about the dangers of nuclear warheads to hopefully avoid ever having one drop again. <p>
