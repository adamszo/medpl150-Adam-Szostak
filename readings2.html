    <p>Reflection on “With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster” by Nesrine Malik</p>
    <p>
      AI slop isn’t the only problem, it feels like everything now is slop. At least especially with short form videos on the rise it just feels like people are making any video they please and you don’t get to pick what you watch but an algorithm picks what you watch and hooks you in for hours. But at least that's human made, having a bunch of code make a video that can be indecipherable from any human made video is where it gets scary. People can very accessibly make AI slop videos now just by searching up “AI video generator” and have the web come up with plenty of results. These generators can be very harmful as the case in the article showing Donald Trump’s twitter having a poorly generated video but one that pushes his agenda. The lack of laws for AI also makes its use questionable, with all the stolen assets that AI trained off of. There is a place in the world for AI but for making videos and art I don’t think that’s one of the uses. The article brings up a good point about how social media platforms don’t really care that there is AI content as long as it keeps the audience engaged and on the app. With people being more used to using AI very casually, there is increased AI use and therefore more AI content. When AI video and images first came out there seemed to be a lot of hate on the online space towards it. Now with apps like tiktok some people even make AI videos to be satirical or just cause they are bored and there isn’t real backlash. So it seems like the world we are headed towards will be full of AI slop. With a rise of conservatism the use of AI also glamorizes white supremacy and fascism. AI pushing this “traditional” way of life and old values is honestly disgusting as with a wide audience of these AI being children/young adults this can lead them down a destructive path. The rise of this AI slop even feels like a slap in the face to intellectualism. With more and more people simply copying and pasting their homework prompt into an AI there is less thinking happening and this can lead to people simply seeing what AI is telling them and going on without questioning it. The new advertisements on the train for the AI friend.com are also disgusting. AI cannot be your friend and it will simply be used as a way to market more things to somebody and spy on people for the company's growth, that’s why it is a startup that has received millions of dollars. If companies like this become a norm then there will no longer be a life without advertisement or surveillance. I’m not sure what a solution could be, at least a realistic one. AI is growing and getting more funding everyday, you can tell people to slow down with the usage to understand the impacts it has on something like their brains or the environment of the world. But I’m not sure if that will work. AI slop is slowly taking over, bots talk to bots, AI videos spread and have millions of views, the internet as we know it is dying.
